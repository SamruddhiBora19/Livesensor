# Livesensor fault detection

## Problem Statement

The Air Pressure System (APS) is a vital component in heavy-duty vehicles, utilizing compressed air to operate a piston that applies pressure to the brake pads, ensuring vehicle deceleration. A key benefit of the APS over hydraulic systems is the natural airâ€™s availability and sustainability. However, the APS is a complex system requiring regular maintenance and checkups to ensure optimal performance. The cost of these checkups, along with the potential for expensive repairs, poses a significant financial burden on fleet operators.

This is a binary classification problem where the positive class indicates a failure caused by a specific component within the APS, while the negative class represents failures caused by other unrelated components. The objective is to minimize the cost associated with unnecessary repairs and reduce the operational downtime for vehicles.

## Proposed Solution

This project focuses on the Air Pressure System (APS), which provides pressurized air for various critical truck functions, including braking and gear shifting. The dataset's positive class corresponds to failures in a specific APS component, while the negative class pertains to trucks experiencing failures in non-APS-related components.

The goal is to reduce the high costs associated with unnecessary diagnostics and repairs by improving the accuracy of failure prediction. By minimizing false positives, we aim to streamline maintenance schedules and optimize repair costs, thereby reducing the financial burden on fleet operators.
